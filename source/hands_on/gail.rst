GAIL 
====

Overview
--------

GAIL (Generative Adversarial Imitation Learning) was first proposed in
`Generative Adversarial Imitation
Learning <https://arxiv.org/abs/1606.03476>`__, is a general framework
for directly extracting policy from data, as if it were obtained by
reinforcement learning following inverse reinforcement learning.
The authors deduced the optimization objective of GAIL from the
perspective of occupancy measure.
Compared to other learning methods, GAIL neither suffers from
the compounding error problem in imitation learning, nor needs to
expensively learn the inter-mediate reward function as in inverse
reinforcement learning. But similar to other methods, GAIL is also
exposed to "the curse of dimensionality", which makes the scalability
much valuable in high-dimension-space problems.

Quick Facts
-----------

1. GAIL consists of a generator and a discriminator, trained in an
   adversarial manner.

2. The generator is optimized for a surrogate reward provided by the
   discriminator, usually by policy-gradient reinforcement learning
   methods, like TRPO, for its sampling nature.

3. The discriminator can be simply optimized by typical gradient descent
   methods, like Adam, to distinguish expert and generated data.

Key Equations or Key Graphs
---------------------------

The objective function in GAIL's adversarial training is as below:

   :align: center


where \pi is the generator policy, D is the discriminator policy,
while :math:`H(\pi)` is the causal entropy of policy \pi. This is a
min-max optimization process, and the objective is optimized in an
iterative adversarial manner. During training, D has to
maximize the objective, while \pi has to counter D by minimizing the
objective.

Extensions
----------

-  MAGAIL (Multi-Agent Generative Adversarial Imitation Learning)

   Multi-agent systems tend to be much more complicated, due to the
   heterogeneity, stochasticity, and interaction among multi-agents.

   `MAGAILï¼šMulti-Agent Generative Adversarial Imitation
   Learning <https://arxiv.org/abs/1807.09936>`_ extended GAIL to
   multi-agent scenarios. The generator is redefined as a policy
   controlling all agents in a distributed manner, while the
   discriminator is distinguishing expert and generates behavior for
   each agent.

   The Pseudo-Code is as following:

-  Other perspectives to understand GAIL

   GAIL is closely related to other learning methods, and thus can be
   understood in different views.

   `A Connection Between Generative Adversarial Networks, Inverse
   Reinforcement Learning, and Energy-Based
   Models <https://arxiv.org/abs/1611.03852>`__ indicated GAIL's
   implicit connection to GAN, IRL, and energy-based probability
   estimation.

Implementation
